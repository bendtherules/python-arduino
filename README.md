python-arduino
==============

python library to locate, upload and communicate with your arduino(s)

Goals 
=====

* Allow a user to programatically locate an arduino, then upload a compiled sketch  
* Establish a simple application layer addressing system for use with multiple arduinos  
* Simplify communication between arduinos and python (for instance send ints, bools, etc.)
* Possibly build call back mechanism for reading serial data in as it arrives (need to do more reading on this)
